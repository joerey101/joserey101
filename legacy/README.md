**Current Version:** v1.0 (Frankenstein Merge)
**Design System:** "Neo-Swiss Pop" (Oyster White / Deep Carbon / Neon Accents)
**Tech Stack:** HTML5 + Tailwind CSS (CDN) + Vanilla JS

## 🚀 Project Context
This project was generated using the **Master Prompt Factory** workflow, fusing the structural DNA of huge agencies (Code & Theory) with the vibrant boldness of "Huge Inc".

### Key Features Implemented:
*   **Hero Section:** "Logic -> Magic" kinetic typography with pulse animations.
*   **Capabilities Processor:** Interactive list that reveals case study previews on hover.
*   **Selected Work:** Asymmetrical "Masonry" grid for case studies (ROI-focused).
*   **Footer:** Massive "Let's Build The Future" call-to-action in Electric Blue.

## 🛠 Next Steps (Roadmap)
When you open this folder as your main workspace, we should focus on:
1.  **Refactor:** Split the giant `index.html` into separate CSS (`style.css`) and JS (`app.js`) files for cleanliness.
2.  **Assets:** Replace the placeholder images (Unsplash) with real renders of your work.
3.  **Performance:** Switch from Tailwind CDN to a proper build process (Vite/Next.js) if we want top speed.
4.  **SEO:** Add meta tags and OpenGraph data.
